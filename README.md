_DEEP LEARNING_

These are Latex slides to complement each one of the book chapters. 
The corresponding PDF files are also provided, but they may not be updated to the last version. In order to make sure that you have the last version, you need to compile the slides. 
We used Overleaf. You just need to clone the files in an Overleaf account and the slides should compile right away. You can also use any latex compiler.
